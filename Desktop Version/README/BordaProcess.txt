Setup-----------------
1. Starting from the main menu, the user inputs their informationm (name, age, etc.)
2. From there, they click the "ready"/"begin" button to  change the UI to the Candidate-setup UI
3. Now inside the candidate menu, the user inputs the names of each of their candidates
4. The user then ranks each candidate, using a more abstracted (aka off-the-cuff) rating.
	- This initial ranking will be used at the end as a comparison to their initial rankings
5. After adding and ranking their candidates, the user is brought to the feature-setup UI
6. Now in the Feature UI, the user inputs their desired features and their negetivity (good or bad)

Calibration-----------
0. Now that all candidates and features have been initialized, the first borda can begin.
1. After the user enters their features, they are brought to the first borda UI, Feature-calibration.
2. The user is repeatedly asked to select which feature is more impactful to them (TODO: seperate neg and pos?)
in the following pattern
	-. The user is shown a training screen, explaining what the next steps are
	A. The user is presented with two features, side by side
	B. The user selects which feature is more impactful
	C. The Feature-index (in the userinfo) selected then has it's weight increased
	D. Repeat until each pairing has shown
	-TODO: account somehow for the left-right bias
3. Once each feature is weighted, run borda's for each Candidate

Candidate borda's---------
0. Now that all features have been weighted, the user is brought to the candidate borda UI
1. The user is repeatedly asked to select which of the candidates' features is most optimal
in the following patter:
	-. The user is shown a training screen, explaining what the next steps are
	A. The user is presented with two features side by side in the context of one candidate
	B. The user then selects which feature is better, in context of the current candidate
	C. The selected feature is given a point
